Dialogs_another_debug_launch_text=A debug launch is already running. While multiple launches can be controlled individually, they interfere with each other's GUI state visualisation.
Dialogs_executionEnginePreferenceChange_caption=Wrong Execution Engine Selected
Dialogs_executionEnginePreferenceChange_text=The selected execution engine is not known to support xUML-RT model execution. Moka execution engine can be set at Window/Preferences/Papyrus/Moka. If you want to change the execution engine to xUML-RT execution engine, click OK, otherwise click Cancel, and the launch is cancelled.
Dialogs_internal_error_caption=Internal error
Dialogs_internal_error_text=An internal error happened. Please report this error to the developers with the log files of the runtime. Email address: support@modelexecution.eltesoft.hu, for the location of the log files, consult the logging.properties file in your project.
Dialogs_invalid_trace_file_caption=Trace file is invalid
Dialogs_invalid_trace_file_text=The trace file selected for replay is invalid. The model could be modified since this trace file was recorded, or the run that recorded the trace did not terminate successfully. The execution must be aborted. Please use a tracefile that was recorded with the current model.
Dialogs_missing_di_notification_caption=Required .di resource not found
Dialogs_missing_di_notification_text=The diagram file {0} required for the model resource {1} is not found.

Dialogs_resources_missing_text=Resources mentioned in the launch config do not exist. Please refresh your launch config before launch.
Dialogs_trace_file_missing_caption=Trace file is missing
Dialogs_trace_file_missing_text=The trace file selected for replay does not exist.

  % logging is done both to file and console: \n\
  handlers=java.util.logging.FileHandler,{3}\n\
  \n\
  % location of the log file: \n\
  java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern=%h/run%u.log\n\
  \n\
  % "/" the local pathname separator \n\
  % "%t" the system temporary directory \n\
  % "%h" the value of the "user.home" system property \n\
  % "%g" the generation number to distinguish rotated logs \n\
  % "%u" a unique number to resolve conflicts \n\
  % "%%" translates to a single percent sign "%" \n\
  % If no "%g" field has been specified and the file count is greater than one, then the generation number will be added to the end of the generated filename, after a dot. \n\
  % Thus for example a pattern of "%t/java%g.log" with a count of 2 would typically cause log files to be written on Solaris to /var/tmp/java0.log and /var/tmp/java1.log whereas on Windows 95 they would be typically written to C:\TEMP\java0.log and C:\TEMP\java1.log \n\
  % Generation numbers follow the sequence 0, 1, 2, etc. \n\
  % Normally the "%u" unique field is set to 0. However, if the FileHandler tries to open the filename and finds the file is currently in use by another process it will increment the unique number field and try again. This will be repeated until FileHandler finds a file name that is not currently in use. If there is a conflict and no "%u" field has been specified, it will be added at the end of the filename after a dot. (This will be after any automatically added generation number.)  \n\
